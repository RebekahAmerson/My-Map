# MyMap App

A map of my hometown of Pittsburg, Kansas, with some iconic Pittsburg places marked on the map.

# To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

# For Production:
* run npm build
* service worker is available after production has been completed.

# How to us:

* To get more information about a place you can either click on the marker on the map or click the list item.
* An infowindow will appear with name, address, phone and a comment on what makes that place great.
